## Milestone 3 CST 391
### 2/25/2024

### Create
!["create"](../Mile3/image/first.png)
- Create operation works great, creating any pokemon I add into the body as json text.

### Read
!["second"](../Mile3/image/second.png)
- Read operation works perfectly, getting all pokemon from the database.

### Update
!["third"](../Mile3/image/third.png)
- So my update function is broken, I can’t figure it out but I am going to fix it and resubmit if I have to.

### Delete
!["fourth"](../Mile3/image/fourth.png)
- Delete Query works perfectly, deleting any pokemon in my database with a specific id, specified at the end of the request.

## Challenges
- This Milestone taught me to be able to re use some code from previous projects, and also what bugs to look out for when doing so.
## Bugs / Lessons Learned
- I have a bug in my put method. All my code looks good, I have no red squiggles, and no errors in the console when I request the put operation, but I don’t get any updates in my database and the console says 0 rows affected.
